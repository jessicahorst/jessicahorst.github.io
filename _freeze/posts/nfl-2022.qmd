```

## Variable Description


## Q2a

In data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs, remove observations for which values of posteam is missing.

```{r}
NFL2022_stuffs <- data.frame(
  posteam = c("TeamA", NA, "TeamB", "TeamC"),
  yards = c(100, 150, 200, 120),
  touchdowns = c(2, 1, 3, 2)

NFL2022_stuffs <- NFL2022_stuffs[complete.cases(NFL2022_stuffs$posteam), ]
```


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
