Lets analyze the `beer_markets` data: 

```{r}
beer_mkts <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
```

## Q1a

Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz.
Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of BUD LIGHT.
Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of BUSCH LIGHT.
Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of COORS LIGHT.
Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of MILLER LITE.
Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of NATURAL LIGHT.

```{r}
Q2a1 <- beer_mkts %>% 
   group_by(market) %>% 
   summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
   arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
   slice(1:5)

Q2a_bud <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "BUD LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q2a_busch <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "BUSCH LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q2a_coors <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "COORS LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q2a_miller <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "MILLER LITE") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q2a_natural <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "NATURAL LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

## Q1b

For households that purchased BUD LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only BUD LIGHT?

For households that purchased BUSCH LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only BUSCH LIGHT?

For households that purchased COORS LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only COORS LIGHT?

For households that purchased MILLER LITE at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only MILLER LITE?

For households that purchased NATURAL LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only NATURAL LIGHT?

Which beer brand does have the largest proportion of such loyal consumers?

```{r}
q2b <- beer_mkts %>% 
  mutate(bud = ifelse(brand=="BUD LIGHT", 1, 0), # 1 if brand=="BUD LIGHT"; 0 otherwise
         busch = ifelse(brand=="BUSCH LIGHT", 1, 0),
         coors = ifelse(brand=="COORS LIGHT", 1, 0),
         miller = ifelse(brand=="MILLER LITE", 1, 0),
         natural = ifelse(brand=="NATURAL LIGHT", 1, 0),
         .after = hh) %>% 
  select(hh:natural) %>%  # select the variables we need
  group_by(hh) %>% 
  summarise(n_transactions = n(), # number of beer transactions for each hh
            n_bud = sum(bud), # number of BUD LIGHT transactions for each hh
            n_busch = sum(busch), 
            n_coors = sum(coors), 
            n_miller = sum(miller), 
            n_natural = sum(natural) 
  ) %>% 
  summarise(loyal_bud = sum(n_transactions == n_bud) / sum(n_bud > 0), 
              # sum(n_transactions == n_bud) : the number of households that purchased BUD LIGHT only
              # sum(n_bud > 0) : the number of households that purchased BUD LIGHT at least once.
            loyal_busch = sum(n_transactions == n_busch) / sum(n_busch > 0),
            loyal_coors = sum(n_transactions == n_coors) / sum(n_coors > 0),
            loyal_miller = sum(n_transactions == n_miller) / sum(n_miller > 0),
            loyal_natural = sum(n_transactions == n_natural) / sum(n_natural > 0)
  )

q2b
```

## Q1c

For each household, calculate the number of beer transactions.
For each household, calculate the proportion of each beer brand choice.

```{r}
q2c <- beer_mkts %>% 
  count(hh, brand) %>% 
  group_by(hh) %>% 
  mutate(n_tot = sum(n)) %>%  # n_tot : the number of beer transactions
  arrange(hh, brand) %>% 
  mutate( prop = n / n_tot ) # prop: the proportion of each beer brand choice
